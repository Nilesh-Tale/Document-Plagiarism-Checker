Exactly I was looking for. All the other answers ` import secondary exec(open('secondary.py').read()) 
os.sys
tem('python secondary.py') call(["python", "secondary.py"]) ` they don't allow creating 
multiple instances of the secondary python file at the same time. They all wait for the execution to 
finish only then you can call that file again. Only Popen allows mu
ltiple async calls. Thanks again.
